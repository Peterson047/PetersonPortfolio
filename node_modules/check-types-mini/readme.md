## Idea

Imagine you have a library where you let users set the options object which comes as one of the input arguments.

Here's a challenge: how do you check (and throw) errors, easily, when users set your options to wrong things?

Answer: this library. It does all the work validating the inputs, lets you customise the `throw` error messages (like below) and even lets you provide the _schema_, that is, array of allowed types that each options key's value should be in.

For example, here's a typical throw error generated by this library:

```js
TypeError: fancyLibrary/fancyFunction(): [THROW_ID_01] opts.placeholder was customised to "false" which is not boolean but string
```

Originally this library started as a function within one of my libraries. When I was about to copy-paste the thing into another library, I stopped and put that into a separate library, _this library_. I'm glad I did it, because already 7 of my libraries depend on it, and improving `check-types` I improve my other libraries. DRY at its best.

The point of `check-types-mini` is to save your time creating new libraries. Every library that has options object will need some **type checks** if you let user tinker with it.

## API

**checkTypes(obj[, ref, opts])**

As a result, it _throws_ `TypeError`s for you, containing your custom message which you optionally set via arguments:

Input argument   | Type         | Obligatory? | Description
-----------------|--------------|-------------|--------------
`obj`            | Plain object | yes         | Options object after user's customisation
`ref`            | Plain object | no^         | Default options - used to compare the types
`opts`           | Plain object | no          | Optional options go here.

^`ref` can be `null` or `undefined` if all keys are set via `opts.schema` (see below).

### Options object

`options` object's key         | Type     | Obligatory? | Default     | Description
-------------------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------------
{                              |          |             |             |
`ignoreKeys`                   | Array or String | no          | `[]` (empty array)   | Instructs to skip all and any checks on keys, specified in this array. Put them as strings.
`acceptArrays`                 | Boolean  | no          | `false`     | If it's set to `true`, value can be array of elements, same type as reference.
`acceptArraysIgnore`           | Array of strings or String | no | `[]` (empty array) | If you want to ignore `acceptArrays` on certain keys, pass them in an array here.
`enforceStrictKeyset`          | Boolean  | no          | `true`      | If it's set to `true`, your object must not have any unique keys that reference object (and/or `schema`) does not have.
`schema`                       | Plain object | no      | `{}`        | You can set arrays of types for each key, overriding the reference object. This allows you more precision and enforcing multiple types.
`msg`                          | String   | no          | ` `         | A message to show. I like to include the name of the calling library, parent function and numeric throw ID.
`optsVarName`                  | String   | no          | `opts`      | How is your options variable called? It does not matter much, but it's nicer to keep references consistent with your API documentation.
}                              |          |             |             |

### For example

The common pattern is,

1. a) Define defaults object. Later it will be used to validate user's options, PLUS, if that's not enough, you can allow users to provide **arrays** of the matching type (set `opts.acceptArrays` to `true`)
1. b) Alternatively, you can skip defaults object and provide schema for each key via `opts.schema`. Just stick an object there, as a value, with all keys. Put allowed types in an array.
2. `Object.assign` cloned defaults onto the options object that comes from the input.
3. call `check-types-mini` with the above.
4. If input types mismatch, error will be `throw`n.

```js
const checkTypes = require('check-types-mini')

function yourFunction (input, opts) {
  // declare defaults, so we can enforce types later:
  const defaults = {
    placeholder: false
  }
  // fill any settings with defaults if missing:
  opts = Object.assign({}, defaults, opts)

  // the check:
  checkTypes(opts, defaults, {msg: 'newLibrary/yourFunction(): [THROW_ID_01]', optsVarName: 'opts'})
  // ...
}

let res = yourFunction(1, {placeholder: 'zzz'})

// =>> [TypeError: 'newLibrary/yourFunction(): [THROW_ID_01] opts.placeholder was customised to "zzz" which is not boolean but string']
```

Sometimes you want to accept either a string (or type "X") or an arrays of strings (elements of type "X"). As long as ALL the elements within the array match the reference type, it's OK. For these cases set `opts.acceptArrays` to `true`.

This will throw:

```js
const checkTypes = require('check-types-mini')
checkTypes(
  { // < input
    option1: 'setting1',
    option2: [true, true],
    option3: false
  },
  { // < reference
    option1: 'setting1',
    option2: false,
    option3: false
  }
)
// => Throws, because reference's `option2` is Boolean ("false") but input `option2` is array ("[true, true]").
```

But when we allow arrays of the matching type, it won't throw anymore:

```js
const checkTypes = require('check-types-mini')
checkTypes(
  {
    option1: 'setting1',
    option2: ['setting3', 'setting4'],
    option3: false
  },
  {
    option1: 'setting1',
    option2: 'setting2',
    option3: false
  },
  {
    acceptArrays: true
  }
)
// => Does not throw, because we allow arrays full of a matching type
```

If you want, you can blacklist certain keys of your objects so that `opts.acceptArrays` will not apply to them. Just add keys into `opts.acceptArraysIgnore` array.

### `opts.enforceStrictKeyset`

When I was coding a new major version of [posthtml-ast-delete-object](https://github.com/codsen/posthtml-ast-delete-object) I had to update all the unit tests too. Previously, the settings were set using only one argument, Boolean-type. I had to change it to be a plain object. I noticed that when I missed updating some tests, their Booleans were `Object.assign`ed into a default settings object and no alarm was being raised! That's not good.

Then I came up with the idea to **enforce the keys of the object** to match the reference and/or schema keys in `options`. It's on by default because I can't imagine how you would end up with settings object that does not match your default settings object, key-wise, but if you don't like that, feel free to turn it off. It's `opts.enforceStrictKeyset` Boolean flag.

### `opts.schema`

Sometimes your API is more complex than a single type or array of them. Sometimes you want to allow, let's say, `string` or `array` of strings or `null`. What do you do?

Enter `opts.schema`. You can define all the types for particular key, as an array:

```js
const checkTypes = require('check-types-mini')
checkTypes(
  {
    option1: 'setting1',
    option2: null
  },
  {
    option1: 'zz',
    option2: 'yy' // << notice, it's given as string in defaults object
  },
  {
    schema: {
      option2: ['stRing', null]
    }
  }
)
// => does not throw
```

The types are case-insensitive and come from [type-detect](https://github.com/chaijs/type-detect), a Chai library:

* `object` (meaning a plain object literal, nothing else)
* `array`
* `string`
* `null`
* and other usual types

The type values you put into `opts.schema` are not validated, on purpose, so please don't make typos.

## Contributing

If you see anything incorrect whatsoever, do [raise an issue](https://github.com/codsen/check-types-mini/issues). If you file a pull request, I'll do my best to merge it quickly. If you have any comments on the code, including ideas how to improve something, don't hesitate to contact me by email.

If something doesn't work as you wished or you don't understand the inner working of this library, _do raise an issue_. I'm happy to explain what's happening. Often some part of my README documentation is woolly, and I can't spot it myself. I need user feedback.

Also, if you miss a feature, request it by [raising](https://github.com/codsen/check-types-mini/issues) an issue as well.

I know it never happens but if you would ever forked it and worked on a new feature, before filing a pull request, please make sure code is following the rules set in `.eslintrc` and `npm run test` passes fine. It's basically an `airbnb-base` rules preset of `eslint` with few exceptions: 1. No semicolons. 2. Allow plus-plus in `for` loops. See `./eslintrc`.

I dropped JS Standard because it misses many useful ESLint rules and has been neglected by its maintainers. At the moment, its ESLint version is six months old, missing one major release.
