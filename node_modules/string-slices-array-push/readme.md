## Install

```bash
$ npm i -S string-slices-array-push
```

```js
const Slices = require('string-slices-array-push')
let slices = new Slices()
slices.add(1, 2)
slices.add(2, 4)
console.log(slices.last())
// => [ [1, 4] ]
slices.add(10, 20)
console.log(slices.current())
// => [ [1, 4], [10, 20] ]
```

## The Idea

Imagine you want to delete a bunch of characters from a string. Like making a bunch of holes in a slice of cheese. An ineffective way is to traverse that string and mutate it on each "hole". The effective way is to gather the indexes of `[from, to]` ranges in an array while traversing, and when string traversal is done, perform all cutting **in one go**. It's like using ten pencils to make ten holes in a slice, all at once. OK, bad example, but you get it. All in one go. That's the plan.

**Challenge: how do you manage those string index ranges?**

`[deleteFromIndex1, deleteToIndex1]`, `[deleteFromIndex2, deteleToIndex2]` and so on.

- What happens when ranges overlap? We need to merge them.
- What happens if new range is located before the last-one? We need to sort them.
- How do you prevent damage when the same range is added multiple times?
- What happens if you want not only to delete, but also, **to add** something? We need to accept third argument, the value to add.
- What happens if you want to only add something, without deletion? We need to accept first and second argument as the same index.

---

**The solution to all these challenges above is...** this library.

---

**PS.** Later, when you're finished with your operations, and you want your string crunched according to your newly-generated array of slices, use [string-replace-slices-array](https://github.com/codsen/string-replace-slices-array) to do the actual deletion/replacement job. It consumes your ranges array and performs all the deletion/replacement tasks on the string at once.

## API

This package exports a constructor, Slices which you first `require`, then call using `new`:

```js
const Slices = require('string-slices-array-push')
let slices = new Slices()
```

The `slices` (with lowercase) is your [class](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20%26%20beyond/ch3.md#classes) which contains your slice ranges and gives you methods to get/set the values.

You then interact with it calling its _methods_:

### slices.add(from, to[, str])

Input argument | Type                    | Obligatory? | Description
---------------|-------------------------|-------------|--------------------
`deleteFrom`   | Integer, natural number | yes         | Beginning index of the slice
`deleteTo`     | Integer, natural number | yes         | Ending index of the slice
`str`          | String                  | no          | If you want not only to delete but [insert](https://github.com/codsen/string-replace-slices-array) something, put that new string here

If you want only to insert and you don't want to delete anything, put both `deleteFrom` and `deleteTo` **the same**.

* If the arguments are of a wrong type, it will `throw` and error.
* Also, if you _overload_ it, providing fourth, fifth input argument and so on if will `throw` too. It's for your own safety because it might flag up something wrong happening in your code.

In essence, `.add()` behaves two ways:

1) `.add(1, 2)`, later `.add(2, 3)` will not create a new `[2, 3]` but extend `[1, 2]` into `[1, 3]`. This is to save time because we prevent bunch of connecting ranges from being recorded as separate ones.
2) all other cases, if it's not an exact extension of a previous range, new range is added into the array. `.add(2, 3)`, later `.add(1, 2)` will result in `[ [2, 3], [1, 2] ]`. The `.current()` method will clean it later. Read on...

### slices.current()

This method fetches the **current** state of your slices array, sorts and **merges it**, then outputs it to you.

Result is either

1) array of slice range arrays like:

```js
[ // notice it's an array of arrays
  [10, 20, ' insert this string after deleting range between indexes 10 & 20']
  [30, 50],
  [51, 55]
]
```

2) or `null` if it's still empty and nothing has been added since.

`.current()` will do the sorting first by `deleteFrom` (first element), then, sorting by `deleteTo` (second element), **then**, it will merge any ranges that overlap.

```js
[[4, 5], [1, 2]] => [[1, 2], [4, 5]] // no overlap, so just sorted by 1st element
```

```js
[[2, 5], [2, 3], [1, 10]] => [[1, 10]] // there was an overlap, so ranges were merged
```

In theory, since `.current()` does not mutate our slices array in the memory, you could add more ranges and call `.current()` again, this time possibly with slightly different result. However, be aware that merging will lose some of the data in the ranges.

Imagine: `[ [10, 20, 'aaa'], [10, 15, bbb]]` was merged by `.current`, and became `[ [10, 20, 'bbbaaa'] ]`. Now if you use this range in [string-replace-slices-array](https://github.com/codsen/string-replace-slices-array) to amend the string, but then later discover that you left out the range `[12, 17, ccc]`, that is, you wanted to delete between indexes 12 and 17, and then insert `ccc`, you'll be in trouble. Since you amended your string, you can't "stick in" `ccc` between original `bbb` and `aaa` â€” your desired place to add `ccc`, at index 17 has been "merged" by `bbb` and `aaa`.

**Conclusion**: complete all your operations, `add()`-ing ranges. Then, fetch your master ranges array _once_, using `.current` and feed it into [string-replace-slices-array](https://github.com/codsen/string-replace-slices-array). At this point don't do any more `add()`ing, or if you really want that, process the ranges you've got using [string-replace-slices-array](https://github.com/codsen/string-replace-slices-array), `wipe()` everything and start `add()`ing again.

### slices.wipe()

Sets your slices array to `null`. Right after that `slices.current()` will yield `null`. You can then start `add`-ing again, from scratch.

### slices.last()

Outputs:

1) the last ranges' array from the slices array, for example:

```js
[51, 55]
```

2) Or, if there's nothing in the slices array yet, `null`.

PSST. Later, feed your ranges array into [string-replace-slices-array](https://github.com/codsen/string-replace-slices-array) to delete/replace all those ranges in your string.

## In my case

Originally this library was part of [email-remove-unused-css](https://github.com/codsen/email-remove-unused-css/), but I tore it off and placed into a separate (this) library when I needed the same function in [html-img-alt](https://github.com/codsen/html-img-alt). Since then, [Detergent](https://github.com/codsen/detergent) also uses it, so its unit test wouldn't take an hour, calculating all possible combinations of the options, while input string is mutated again and again in the for loop.

This library is part one of two library combo, second one being [string-replace-slices-array](https://github.com/codsen/string-replace-slices-array).

## Contributing

If you see anything incorrect whatsoever, do [raise an issue](https://github.com/codsen/string-slices-array-push/issues). If you file a pull request, I'll do my best to merge it quickly. If you have any comments on the code, including ideas how to improve something, don't hesitate to contact me by email.

If something doesn't work as you wished or you don't understand the inner working of this library, _do raise an issue_. I'm happy to explain what's happening. Often some part of my README documentation is woolly, and I can't spot it myself. I need user feedback.

Also, if you miss a feature, request it by [raising](https://github.com/codsen/string-slices-array-push/issues) an issue as well.

I know it never happens but if you would ever forked it and worked on a new feature, before filing a pull request, please make sure code is following the rules set in `.eslintrc` and `npm run test` passes fine. It's basically an `airbnb-base` rules preset of `eslint` with few exceptions: 1. No semicolons. 2. Allow plus-plus in `for` loops. See `./eslintrc`.

I dropped JS Standard because it misses many useful ESLint rules and has been neglected by its maintainers, using half-year-old version of ESLint.

Cheers!
